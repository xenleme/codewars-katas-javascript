// John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He has been said that making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper
// is more complex than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method to getting it right.
//
// John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters.
// The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters.
// He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or
// miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.
//
// Last time he did these calculations he caught a headache so could you help John? Your function wallpaper(l, w, h)
// should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.
//
// #Example: wallpaper(4, 3.5, 3) should return "ten"
//
// #Notes:
//
// all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
// 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
// the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20

function wallpaper(l, w, h) {
  const numbers = [
    'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four',
    'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine',
    'ten', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen',
    'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen',
    'eighteen', 'nineteen', 'twenty'
  ];

  return l * w * h === 0 ? 'zero' : numbers[Math.ceil(2 * h * (l + w) / 0.52 / 10 * 1.15)];
}
